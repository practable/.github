# Declarations of copyright

Please submit a PR if you wish to declare your institution/employer as a copyright holder for your contributions, adding your name and details to the list below. 

## Copyright 
Acknowledging an institutional copyright holder for your contributions is beneficial to you, your institution and the project. The existence of many copyright holders in an open-source project is not only normal (some have thousands) but also beneficial, because it helps keep the project open for the benefit of the community. This document is not a formal legal opinion; it is a best-effort attempt to simultaneously juggle the practicalities of real-world open-source development and institutional policies which are still catching-up with the need for wording that accommodates it. 

## Encouraged to share
Many institutions operate Open Educational Resource policies that encourage that staff and students to share their creations under open-source licenses, and typically no approval process is needed. [Example](https://open.ed.ac.uk/about/).  

## Contribution licensing
Github makes licensing simple with ["in-bound=out-bound" licensing] (https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#6-contributions-under-repository-license). There are no separate contributer license agreements needed. This helps reduce the friction around contributing, which is important to the health of the community (e.g. a few lines quickly submitted can fix an issue efficiently for all concerned).

## Who holds the copyright to your contribution?
If you are a student then your contributions are typically under your own copyright, the same as for a personal contributer, whereas if you are a staff member then the institution (or company) usuaully expects to be the copyright holder. 

## Copyright notices
Github [recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts) users only have a single account for their paid employment and their personal projects, so it is often easier to stick to making commits with a single email address, which may or may not be a work address. If you use your work email address, we can easily infer that your employer is the copyright holder. If you use your personal email address for Github (e.g. to avoid seeing admin emails while coding) but would like to declare that your contributions to practable are copyright to your institution/employer, then you can make a note of this below by forking this repo, editing this doc to add your name, and submitting a PR.
