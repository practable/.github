Open-source digital infrastructure and hardware for world-wide sharing of remote laboratories in education.

## Why remote laboratories?

Learners require greater access to practical work in order to achieve today's educational goals. Remote laboratories help overcome the resource squeeze and open new opportunities for pedagogical developments.

## Why open source?

Learners and facilitators across courses, institutions and countries benefit from each other's rapid and unfettered developments in this exciting field of digital education, without the limitations of proprietary approaches or the risks of vendor lock-in.

## Why share?

A shared approach lowers the barrier to entry for everyone, so we can all grow our activities across the widest ranges of budgets and timescales. 

## What does a remote lab actually look like? 

Remote laboratories come in all shapes and sizes. Our first adopters are focusing on form-factors that let them use public spaces on their campuses. The most recent designs are housed in model shipping containers, to represent the hybrid travel that takes place when a learner accesses an experiment. The first generation wooden boxes have a variegated front panel design to represent the blending of online and in-person spaces.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions, feature requests, and issues. We're still developing documentation for all the great stuff we've built so far, so a fully asynchronous non-gatekeeper approach to contributions is slightly further down the road. Meanwhile, just drop Tim a message at <tim@practable.io> to get started. If you like the idea of remote labs, but are not sure whether it would work for you, we're also keen to hear about what your particular barriers to adoption might be. Perhaps we are already working on a solution not visible here.
