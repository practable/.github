Open-source digital infrastructure and hardware for world-wide sharing of remote laboratories in education.

## Why remote laboratories?

Learners require greater access to practical work in order to achieve today's educational goals. Remote laboratories help overcome the resource squeeze and open new opportunities for pedagogical developments.

## Why open source?

Learners and facilitators across courses, institutions and countries benefit from each other's rapid and unfettered developments in this exciting field of digital education, without the limitations of proprietary approaches or the risks of vendor lock-in.

## Why share?

A shared approach lowers the barrier to entry for everyone, so we can all grow our activities across the widest ranges of budgets and timescales. 

## What does a remote lab actually look like? 

Remote laboratories come in all shapes and sizes. Our first adopters are focusing on form-factors that let them use public spaces on their campuses. The most recent designs are housed in model shipping containers, to represent the hybrid travel that takes place when a learner accesses an experiment. The first generation wooden boxes have a variegated front panel design to represent the blending of online and in-person spaces.

## Contributing / Adopting

We very much welcome contributions, feature requests, and issues. Our contribution and licensing guidelines are [here](https://github.com/practable/.github/blob/522a3ff4bb039da113a273b92cf73436778faf2f/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). The code is changing rapidly as we work toward the v1 release so please contact us first before getting started - just drop Tim a message at <tim@practable.io> or <timothy.drysdale@ed.ac.uk>.

### Licensing and Open Educational Resource policies - low friction, for the good of the community
In short, everything is open-source but the license varies to suit the type of contribution (e.g. hardware designs are different to server code). Your institution probably already has an [open educational resource policy](https://open.ed.ac.uk/) permitting you to start contributing immediately without asking any further permission. In these cases, to keep life simple for you and for us, we'll assume your contributions are copyright your institution, regardless of what email your Github account uses. Multiple copyright holders is normal for open-source projects, and helps keep projects open, for the good of the community. In fact, there is a free Practable mug (UK-shipping paid) for the first contribution from another institution to the AGPLv3 code!

### Future involvements
If you like the idea of remote labs, but are not sure whether it would work for you, we're also keen to hear about what your particular barriers to adoption might be. Perhaps we are already working on a solution not visible here.
